# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This project has focud on backend of WTWR and making the REST Api for our WTWR application, and we are preapring our application for future cod to add more functionality to it.
We have used NodeJS and related technologies like MongoDB, because they are all JavaScript frienly and working together well and easy.
We're going to add more features and tools in future updates of project.

## What technologies we used:

- Express : Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License.
- NodeJs : Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.
- Mongoose : Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Mongoose supports Node.js and Deno (alpha).
- REST API : A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.
- Postman : Postman is an API Platform for developers to design, build, test and iterate their APIs.
- ESLint : ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
